# Research Paper - Minor Research in Emerging Technologies

The LaTeX version of the final research paper.

# Overview

The [`paper.pdf`](paper.pdf) file is the final resulting paper.
The [`paper.tex`](paper.tex) file is the LaTeX source file.
The [`paper.bib`](paper.bib) file is the BibTeX reference database file.

# Getting Started

First off, in order to support ACM style, 2 additional files are needed. These are:

- [The `acmart.cls` file](http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/acmart/current/acmart.cls) for `\documentclass[sigconf](acmart)`.
- [The ACM Reference Format](http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/acmart/current/ACM-Reference-Format.bst) file for BibTeX.

Put these in the same directory as where you cloned this repository.

Now you can edit and build the paper.
