# Research Paper - Minor Research in Emerging Technologies

The LaTeX version of the final research paper.

# Overview

The [`paper.pdf`](paper.pdf) file is the final resulting paper.
The [`paper.tex`](paper.tex) file is the LaTeX source file.
The [`paper.bib`](paper.bib) file is the BibTeX reference database file.

# Getting Started

First off, in order to support ACM style, 2 additional files are needed. These are:

- [The `acmart.cls` file](http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/acmart/current/acmart.cls) for `\documentclass[sigconf](acmart)`.
- [The ACM Reference Format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borisveytsman/acmart/master/ACM-Reference-Format.bbx) file for BibTeX.

Put these in the same directory as where you cloned this repository.

Now you can edit and build the paper.

Alternatively, open a terminal and do the following steps:

- `cd` to the directory where you want to clone this repo (e.g. `cd ~/Documents`)
- `git clone https://github.com/drtheuns/minor_riet_paper`
- `cd minor_riet_paper`
- `./download_sources`
